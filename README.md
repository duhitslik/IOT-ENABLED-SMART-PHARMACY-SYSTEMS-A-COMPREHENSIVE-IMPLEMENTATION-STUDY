# IOT-ENABLED-SMART-PHARMACY-SYSTEMS-A-COMPREHENSIVE-IMPLEMENTATION-STUDY
System Architecture project for an internship with the use of NIRYO 2 robot.
OUR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE TO DEMONSTRATE A ROBUST PHARMACY AUTOMATION SYSTEM IS BASED ON A ROBOTIC-ARM- ASSISTED IOT SYSTEM, STRUCTURED INTO FOUR DIS TINCT LAYERS: THE SENSING LAYER, FUNCTIONAL LAYER, CONNECTION LAYER, SERVICE LAYER, AND DISPENSING LAYER EACH WITH SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITIES.

THE SYSTEM INCLUDES CRUCIAL FUNCTIONALITIES FOR PHARMACY AUTOMATION, SUCH AS SENDING COMMANDS TO THE ROBOT TO MOVE TO SPECIFIC POSES, GRASP OBJECTS, AND INTERACT WITH THE ROBOT’S TOOLS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PHARMACY AUTOMATION SYSTEM HANDLES THE ROBOT’S VISION SYSTEM BY IDENTIFYING MEDICATIONS BASED ON COLOUR MARKERS. THE FUNCTIONAL LAYER PROCESSES DATA FROM THE VISION SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE CORRECT MEDICATION IS PICKED, THUS MAKING EFFICIENT USE OF THE VISION PICK FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NIRYO NED 2 ROBOT.
